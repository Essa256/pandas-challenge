# Exploratory Analysis of School District Data

## Introduction

This report presents a comprehensive analysis of school district data through Python programming. The analysis encompasses computation and visualization of various metrics associated with student performance, school budget allocation, and school size metrics. The dataset used for this analysis is sourced from CSV files, reflecting the entirety of the school district's data.

## Setup Instructions

To execute the comprehensive analysis:

1. Ensure Python is installed on your system.
2. Install necessary Python libraries if not already installed. You can use pip to install them:

   ```bash
   pip install pandas
   ```

3. Download the CSV files containing the school and student data.
4. Modify the script as necessary to specify the file paths for the CSV files.
5. Execute the Python script to generate comprehensive analysis results and visualizations for the entire school district.

## Analysis Overview

The analysis is structured into several sections, each delving into specific facets of the school district data:

### 1. District Overview

Provides an overview of the entire school district, including the total number of schools, students, budget allocation, average math and reading scores, and the percentage of students passing math and reading.

### 2. School Performance Analysis

Analyzes the performance of individual schools within the district, computing metrics such as average math and reading scores, percentage of students passing math and reading, and overall passing rates for each school.

### 3. Top and Bottom Performing Schools

Identifies and ranks the top-performing and bottom-performing schools in the district based on their overall passing rates.

### 4. Grade-Level Performance Analysis

Breaks down the average math and reading scores by grade level (9th, 10th, 11th, and 12th) for each school across the district.

### 5. Analysis by School Spending

Categorizes schools by spending per student and computes averages for math and reading scores, as well as the percentage of students passing math and reading, for different spending ranges.

### 6. Analysis by School Size

Categorizes schools by size (small, medium, or large) within the district and calculates average scores and passing percentages based on school size.

### 7. Analysis by School Type

Categorizes schools by type (charter or district) within the district and calculates average scores and passing percentages based on school type.
